 * <p/>
 * This class is not for you if...
 * 1) You do not need to perform any action after command execution
 * you want a Thread not this.
 * 2) You need to perform more complex tasks in doInBackground
 * than simple script/command sequence of commands
 * you want your own AsyncTask not this.
 * <p/>
 * This class is for you if...
 * 1) You need to run a command/script/sequence of commands without
 * blocking the UI thread and you must perform actions after the
 * task completes.
 * 2) see #1.
