IMSI-Catchers are false mobile towers (base stations) acting between the target mobile phone(s) and the real towers of service providers. As such they are considered a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack. In the USA the IMSI-Catcher technology is known under the name \"[StingRay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker)\".

IMSI-Catchers also allow adversaries to intercept your conversations, text messages, and data. Police can use them to determine your location or to find out who is in a given geographic area at what time. Identity thieves can use freely [available tools](http://www.nsaplayset.org/) to monitor and manipulate communications from a parked car in your residential neighborhood; notably for stealing passwords or credit card data from people nearby who make purchases on their phones.\r\n\r\nThe reason IMSI-Catchers are so commonly used is that it is very easy to get away with using them traceless. This app aims to make it possible to detect the IMSI-Catchers so that using them becomes a risky proposition. It also aims to make users safer by alerting on possible interception and tracking.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Warnings\r\n\r\n[![Warning](https://spideroak.com/share/IFEU2U2JINCA/GitHub/home/SecUpwN/SpiderOak/DOCUMENTATION/Warning.png)](https://github.com/CellularPrivacy/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/wiki/Development-Status)\r\n\r\nPlease read our [Disclaimer](https://github.com/CellularPrivacy/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/DISCLAIMER)!
