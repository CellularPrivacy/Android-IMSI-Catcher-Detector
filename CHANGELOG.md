* Complete revamp of our [PAPERS-Directory](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/tree/master/PAPERS). Make sure to grab your nightly lecture.

#### 06.04.2014

* Applause to [xLaMbChOpSx](https://github.com/xLaMbChOpSx)! He submitted a new [pull request](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/pull/14) with a complete rewrite of the menu system, implementing the Actionbar, rewrite of the Device class to perform better and change it from a static class, Persistent notification was added which can be tweaked down the line and the Database helper class was created to provide application wide support.
* The old Icons of RawPhone have been fully replaced by the great work of [SgtObst](https://github.com/SgtObst). More to come soon!
* Our developers are currently working **hard** to find viable ways to acquire the ciphering info - if you have **good** ideas or code and are a programmer, feel free to perticipate in the discussion on the [official development thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1422969) (only technical talk).

#### 02.04.2014

#### 27.03.2014

* A few team members reported that they've been crawled by IP adresses that where not connected to any country (probably   secret agencies) and stalked by members of the famous company Rohde & Schwarz (the leading manufacturer for   
  IMSI-Catchers). We know that with our actions we already have attracked forces out there which get their will through 
  more brutal methods. Thus, we added a small [Disclaimer](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/DISCLAIMER). Just to mention it: I always have the latest copy of everything. Enjoy!

#### 25.03.2014

* Progress! We've merged an [Intitial Development Commit](/https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/pull/5) by [xLaMbChOpSx](https://github.com/xLaMbChOpSx). HUGE THANKS!
