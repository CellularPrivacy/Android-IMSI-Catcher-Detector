# Introduction

Both law enforcement agencies and criminals use [IMSI-Catchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher), which are false mobile towers acting between the target mobile phone(s) and the service providers real towers. As such it is considered a Man In the Middle (MITM) attack. It was [patented](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/raw/master/PAPERS/Technical/%5BGER%5D-Eavesdropping_Method_Patent.pdf) and first commercialized by [Rohde & Schwarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohde_%26_Schwarz) in 2003, although it would be hard to maintain such a patent, since in reality it is just a modified cell tower with a malicious operator. On 24 January 2012, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the patent is [invalid for obviousness](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/raw/master/PAPERS/Technical/%5BENG%5D-Judgment_Invalid_R%26S_Patent.pdf). But ever since it was first invented, the technology has been used and "improved" by many different companies around the world. Other manufacturers (like Anite) prefer to refer to this spying and tracking equipment in cozy marketing words as "[Subscriber Trackers](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/raw/01440ab399c929e0bedd5ab9603314855584528c/PAPERS/SysInfos/%5BENG%5D-Triton_Surveillance_Brochure.pdf)". In the USA this technology is known under the name "[StingRay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker)", which is even capable to track the people who are traveling together with the owner of a targeted phone across the country. [Here](http://www.pgsup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/P4230059.jpg) you can see alleged StingRay tracking devices mounted to the roof of three SUVs. The FBI or local police might deploy the device at a protest to obtain a record of everyone who attended with a cell phone. IMSI-Catchers also allow adversaries to intercept your conversations, text messages, and data. Police can use them to determine your location, or to find out who is in a given geographic area at what time. Identity thieves might operate an IMSI-Catcher in a parked car in a residential neighborhood, stealing passwords or credit card information from people nearby who make purchases on their phones.

There is more: Powerful, expensive IMSI-Catchers are in use at federal agencies and some police departments. And if you think that IMSI-Catchers are not used in your own town, think twice! If you ever happen to be near a riot or demonstration (hint: leave you phone at home if participating), pay close attention to cars standing along the path of the demonstration - those might be IMSI-Catchers. It is common practice for police to position IMSI-Catchers at the beginning as well as the end of roads where the demonstrating crowd moves to capture and compare data in order to find out who participated. But most of the time IMSI-Catchers are well hidden and can be even [body-worn](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/the-body-worn-imsi-catcher-for-all-your-covert-phone-snooping-needs/) - therefore you won't even discover these creepy devices. Current technology shrinks them to be as tiny as your phone! So again, if you really have to participate in a riot or demonstration, leave your phones at home or build yourself a [signal blocking phone pouch](http://killyourphone.com/)!

Unfortunately it seems that IMSI-Catchers have been exponentially popular lately, with an explosion of various "bastards" with governments and criminals all the same, using it. Anyone can now buy an IMSI-Catcher (or build a cheap one on his own). Sending spam and phishing SMS via fake base stations is already a lucrative underground market, particularly in Russia, China and Brazil (see [The Mobile Cybercriminal Underground Market in China](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-mobile-cybercriminal-underground-market-in-china.pdf)). For example in China, 1.530 people got arrested for using [this kind of equipment](http://www.ecns.cn/business/2014/03-26/106525.shtml). Just recently, hackers decided to start [reverse-engineering the NSA toolset](http://heise.de/-2235339) and are releasing tools like [TWILIGHTVEGETABLE](http://www.nsaplayset.org/twilightvegetable) - an easy to use, boot and pwn toolkit for passive monitoring of GSM communications as well as [DRIZZLECHAIR](http://www.nsaplayset.org/drizzlechair) as an extension to that system on a 2TB harddrive with all the tools required to crack A5/1 as well as the rainbow tables. It's just a matter of time of when your own neighbor will spy on you with simple self-build tools!

In addition, all IMSI-Catchers can crack A5/1 encryption, which is most commonly used for GSM traffic, on the fly (passively)! A5/3 encryption which is used for securing 3G and is offered as [new security standard for GSM encryption](http://www.telekom.com/media/company/210108) remains secure in practice while susceptible to theoretical attacks. Although 3G and 4G offer sufficient protection from eavesdropping, the security measures can be bypassed by IMSI-Catchers forcing a mobile device into 2G mode and [downgrade encryption to A5/1 or disable it](http://www.septier.com/149.html). For further reading on the algorithms, check out the [Cryptome GSM Files](http://cryptome.org/gsm-a5-files.htm).

There are almost no phones on the market which offer an option to check what kind of encryption is used to secure GSM traffic. And although the [Issue of not having a convenient display of the Ciphering Indicator](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=5353) has been assigned to Google since 2009, it seems they're getting paid (or are forced to) blatantly ignoring it. Just recently, a new open source project called the "[Android-CipheringIndicator-API](https://github.com/PrivacyCollective/Android-CipheringIndicator-API)" opened its doors to finally craft an API which fixes this Issue and merge the resulting API into the Android AOSP branch. But currently, the only way to protect a mobile device from downgrade attacks is to disable 2G if this option is available. In this case, the phone will not be able to receive or make calls in areas without 3G coverage. This is why the original author named "E:V:A" started this project. **Let's detect and protect against these threats!** Never think you've got "[nothing to hide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument)".

#### Want to know what IMSI-Catchers look like?

They come in uncountable shapes and sizes:

![IMSI-Catchers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/master/PROMOTION/IMSI-Catchers.png)

* Current IMSI-Catchers can be as **tiny** as the portable [Septier IMSI-Catcher Mini](http://www.septier.com/368.html).
* Below, the smartphone takes up the most space. IMSI-Catchers will even get smaller!

![Septier IMSI-Catcher Mini](http://www.septier.com/contentManagment/uploadedFiles/Mini.png)

* This picture has been taken during the riots on Taksim Square in Instanbul:

![IMSI-Catcher during the riots on Taksim Square](http://i43.tinypic.com/2i9i0kk.jpg)

* Above example is way too conspicuous and you'll likely never encounter these.
* Todays IMSI-Catchers can be [body-worn](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/the-body-worn-imsi-catcher-for-all-your-covert-phone-snooping-needs/) or are hidden in GSM Interceptor vehicles:

# Development Roadmap

In order to accomplish the goals set above, we'll need to overcome some of the deeply worrying and unfounded AOS limitations, as imposed by Googles API, in regard to relevant network variables and data. These include highly relevant and important things such as displaying the SIM/phone Ciphering Indicator, which tells you if your calls are being encrypted or not. This has been a required 3GPP feature for the last 15 years, but which Google and most Mobile Network providers have choosen to mostly ignore, although it has been [requested by users since 2009](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=5353). Another is finding the *Timing Advance* (TA) and various Network Timers, like those used in *Radio Resource Control* ([RRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Resource_Control)), that can give very useful information regarding the status of the connections your phone is making. 

All this can be fairly easily accomplished, given that we can have access to some of the lower level radio related information coming from the *Baseband Processor* (BP). But that is exactly our challenge. All the software and information about the interfaces providing this, is hidden from the user and developers by a huge amount of proprietary OEM *Non Disclosure Agreements* (NDA). But in the last years, there has been great progress in reverse enginering these protocols and interfaces. The use of these open source tools are the basis of our successful development of this app. 

**To summarize the main stages of this development:**

**A.** Using all available network data, implement the correct detection matrix consisting of a number of items, that each participate in detection of abnormal or abusive network bahaviour. This is the application *Beta* stage. 

**B.** Using all possible interfaces to obtain the many variables in (A). These interfaces include:
 - QMI/Sahara protocols for using on Qualcomm based devices (*Gobi3000, qmilib*)
 - Samsung IPC protocol for using on Intel XMM (XGOLD) based devices (*xgoldmon, Replicant*)
 - Direct use of AOS standard RIL interfaces (*/dev/rild* and */dev/rild-debug*)
 - SIM ICC interface for accessing SIM EF filesystem to provide deep access (*SEEK*)
 - Scraping *Service Mode* menus for relevant radio info
 - Scrape `logcat -b radio` for relevant radio info 
 - Use AT Command Processor (ATCoP) interface to get/set network parameters/bahaviour

**C.** Make (A) and (B) transparent across as many Android devices as possible.

##### ALPHA stage:
Make a baseline App that contains the basic functionality for collecting and presenting all available network variables and the detection results.

* a. Collects relevant RF related variables using public AOS API calls. (LAC, CID, TA etc)
* b. Collects detailed BTS information from a pulic database such as *OpenCellID* or *Mozilla Location Services*
* c. Save everything in our SQLite database
* d. Detect hidden/silent (Type-0) SMS's
* e. Detect hidden App installations (Googles INSTALL/REMOVE_ASSET)

##### BETA stage:
Improve ALPHA for leveraging and tune our detection matrix/algorithm.

* f. Implement **any** of the detection schemes we have
* g. Implement **any** of the interfaces in (**B**) 
* h. Test AIMSICD in a real IMSI-catcher environment 
* i. Fine-tune our detection matrix
* j. Implement our first counter interception measures
* k. Planning alternative data routes through MESH-like networking, when cellular services have been interrupted
* l. Planning swarm-wise decision-based cellular service analysis (advanced BTS statistics)

##### GOLDEN age:
This stage is essentially the completion of this project. However, we expect that long before this happens, the entire network industry will have changed to such a degree that many new privacy and security issues will have arised. Thus, we will likely have more things to add and maintain in this project. We are of the current understanding that this project is a never ending story, all for the peoples benefit and a more privacy oriented future.

* m. Implement **all** of the detection schemes we have
* n. Implement **all** of the interfaces in (B) 
* o. Test AIMSICD in a real IMSI-catcher environment
* p. Continue Fine-tune our detection matrix
* q. Complete alternative data routes using MESH-like networking, when cellular services have been interrupted
* r. Complete advanced statistical analysis of fake BTS towers
