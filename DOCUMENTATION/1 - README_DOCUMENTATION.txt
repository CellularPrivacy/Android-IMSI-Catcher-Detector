# README of the DOCUMENTATION Directory
---------------------------------------

Welcome to our documentation material!

This directory shall ONLY contain pictures and files used to document our project.
Please name all files appropriately and make sure all metadata has been purged!


# Removing sensitive information
--------------------------------

* Protect yourself and entirely remove all metadata from your file!
* To remove all metadata from files in a folder, use PDFMtEd Inspector.

PDFMtEd Inspector is a general purpose metadata viewer and cleaner.
Aside from granting a quick and easy insight into the meta information
stored in your files, it also allows you to quickly and effectively
purge all metadata. It is a more secure solution than exiftool alone.
